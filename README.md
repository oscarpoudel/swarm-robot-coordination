# Virtual Force-driven Coachbot Swarm Navigation

This project implements a **decentralized swarm navigation algorithm** inspired by natural systems such as bird flocks and fish schools. Using the **[Coachbot swarm robotics platform](https://github.com/CoachbotSwarm/User-Guide)**, robots perform **circular motion around a nucleus point** while maintaining cohesion and avoiding collisions. The algorithm combines **circular, cohesion, and separation forces** to enable smooth, collision-free, and scalable swarm behavior.

## Features
- Virtual force-driven swarm coordination  
- Decentralized communication with neighbors  
- Simulation and real-world validation using Coachbots  
- Applications in surveillance, monitoring, and distributed sensing  

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository  
2. Install dependencies (Python 3.x, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
3. Run the simulator scripts in the `simulator/` folder  
4. Deploy to real robots using the Coachbot API
